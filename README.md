# (Dynamic) The Price is Right
### By Andrew Thomas

### DESCRIPTION:
All items on eBay can be found at www.ebay.com/itm/A12DigitIDNumber. This program creates random 12-digit codes
until a valid one is found and then scrapes the data from the page in order to put it into a The Price is Right minigame. Run the GUI.py script to play.

### DISCLAIMER:
Due to the to the totally random nature of the items being found, it is possible to find obscene material that the
user finds objectionable. This is a risk the user takes by using the program and, in the current state, cannot be avoided.
In the event that such an item is found, simply click the "New Game" button to find a new item.

### IMPORTANT USABILITY NOTES:
Please do not, at any time, for any reason click on another window in your computer while playing the game, including
when the program is searching for an item. There is an unknown bug that causes the game to crash when making it the
active window on your computer. 

Also, the process of finding an item can take up to several minutes to complete (tests show an average of three and a half
minutes). I recommend grabbing a book or another task not performed on your computer to perform while the game is
searching for an item. Remember, doing other tasks on your computer will cause the program to crash when an item is found.

Clicking the red X in the window will not cause the program to close. Please use the quit button if you wish to exit the
program.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
### MENU:
Select your desired game from the choices available and hit confirm. If you wish to quit, hit the namesake button. If you enjoy recursion, follow the instructions in the README
### ONE AWAY:
Once the item is found, each integer in the actual price is increased or decreased by one and displayed on the screen. It is your job to guess the correct price by increasing or decreasing each number displayed back to the original price. Be careful, once one of the arrows is pressed, the number is changed and cannot be changed again until the next turn. You have two turns to guess the correct price and the number of integers you have right from your first guess will be displayed at the completion of your first turn. The game is best played with items with prices greater than $1000. For full enjoyment, you may have to manually enter a product ID of an expensive item (your favorite car perhaps?) into the code.
### RANGE GAME:
Once the item is found, a scale is drawn with a range of prices. The actual price of the item is within the scale somewhere and it is your job to guess where it is. Once the start button is pressed, the red guess range starts moving up the whole scale. It is your job to click the stop button when you believe the price of the item is within the boundaries of the red guess range. If it reaches the top without being manually stopped, you automatically lose.
